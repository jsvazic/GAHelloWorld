// particular algorithm, ascii value difference doesn't matter, i.e. there's no
// difference between "difference of a and z" and "differenceo of a and b".
// Thus, the evaluation function should not make a difference on that.
// Otherwise, "Gckkp, Xpskc!" will rank better than "Hello, Worzz!", which
// leads the evolving to a wrong direction.
