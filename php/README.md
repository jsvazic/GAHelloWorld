# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (PHP Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in PHP.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with PHP 5.3.

## Usage

The project is completely self contained. To execute the application, run
the following command from a shell (assuming that php-cli is on your 
system path):

> php sample.php
